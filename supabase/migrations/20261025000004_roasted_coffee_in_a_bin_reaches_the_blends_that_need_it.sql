-- Roasted coffee in a bin reaches the blends that need it.
--
-- Owner, 2026-10-25: *"wiring them in obviously"* and *"make sure whatever
-- engine those feed they feed in together. so you put in a nobu espresso in
-- bin and in bags, they both feed into the demand calcs."* Bins-by-recipe and
-- bags landed in 20261025000003. This is the third pile: BINS BY COFFEE,
-- roasted single origin sitting in a bin that has not been blended yet.
--
--     bins, by recipe    roast_stock_log  stock_type='blend'       20260829...
--     bags               pack_stock_count                          000003
--     BINS BY COFFEE     roast_stock_log  stock_type='origin'      this one
--
-- Until now the operator could type that number on Plan Inputs and the engine
-- ignored it, so the Roast Plan asked for coffee that was already roasted and
-- standing in the room.
--
-- ── WHY THE COMPONENT LANE ONLY, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A CHOICE ─────────────
--
-- Owner: *"1. that is true for a post blend recipe but not preblend."* A
-- Pre-Blend is roasted as mixed GREEN, so a bin of roasted single origin
-- physically cannot serve one. It must never reduce a Pre-Blend's plan.
--
-- The lane boundary already draws that line and nothing had to be added:
--
--   component_raw  WHERE roast_type IS DISTINCT FROM 'Pre-Blend' AND has components
--   recipe_level   WHERE roast_type = 'Pre-Blend' OR has no components
--
-- So wiring the pool into the component lane reaches Post-Blend AND Single
-- Origin (83 of prod's 84 single origins carry a 100% component row, which is
-- what supplies the join key) and reaches no Pre-Blend at all. The one
-- componentless recipe on prod is unreachable for a harder reason: with no
-- recipe_components row there is no coffee id to join on, so the recipe lane
-- has no key for this pool even if it wanted one.
--
-- ── THE ALLOCATION, AND WHY IT IS CAPPED TWICE ────────────────────────────
--
-- One bin of Nobu can serve every recipe that uses Nobu, so handing the whole
-- pool to each row would spend the same coffee N times. Each row is allocated
-- its share of the pool in proportion to what it still needs, then capped at
-- what it still needs:
--
--   pool_residual        = GREATEST(0, component_demand_buf - effective_stock)
--   pool_residual_total  = sum(pool_residual) OVER (company, facility, origin)
--   origin_applied       = LEAST(pool_residual, pool_lbs * pool_residual / pool_residual_total)
--
-- 🔴 THE SUM CANNOT EXCEED THE PILE, which is the only property that matters:
--   pool >= total  ->  every row gets its residual, sum = total <= pool
--   pool <  total  ->  every row gets pool * share,  sum = pool
-- A row that needs nothing is allocated nothing and does not eat the pile.
--
-- ── 🔴 CURRENT ROAST WEEK ONLY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO MOVEMENT LEDGER ───────
--
-- The blend anchor can trust a three-week-old count because it knows what
-- happened since: roasts in, deliveries out. This pile has no such ledger.
-- Coffee leaves a bin by being BLENDED, and `blending_worksheet` holds 17 rows
-- on prod ever, across every tenant since launch. Post-roast blending is
-- effectively unrecorded, so a decay term here would be invented arithmetic.
--
-- Carrying an old count forward undecayed is the worse error: 500 lb counted
-- three weeks ago and blended away since would suppress 500 lb of roasting
-- every week forever, which is the same never-washes-out drift that made bags
-- need an anchor in the first place. So an uncounted pile is worth ZERO, which
-- matches what `roast_detail` already does with this pile, and leaves the
-- error in the direction where the roastmaster can see it: the plan asks for
-- coffee that is already in the room, and he skips it.
--
-- ── 🔴 AN IN-WEEK ORIGIN COUNT ALSO FLOORS THE ROASTED-SINCE WINDOW ───────
--
-- Without this the pile double counts against roasting. Roast 100 lb of Nobu
-- on Monday against House Blend: `component_roasted` is 100. Count the Nobu
-- bin on Tuesday and find those same 100 lb: the pool is 100. The engine would
-- believe 200 lb of Nobu is available and roast nothing.
--
-- So the window already floored at the in-week BLEND count is now floored at
-- the in-week ORIGIN count as well, by the same reasoning: a count supersedes
-- the ledger entries it came after. GREATEST ignores NULL, so with no origin
-- count the expression is byte-for-byte the old behaviour.
--
-- This can under-report, when Monday's roast went into a bin that was not the
-- one counted on Tuesday. That is the safe direction and it is the argument
-- for forcing ONE counting session rather than letting the three piles be
-- counted on three different days.
--
-- 🔴 THE THREE PILES ARE ADDITIVE AND THE OPERATOR KEEPS THEM DISJOINT. A bin
-- is either labelled with a recipe or labelled with a coffee, never both, and
-- bags are not bins. Plan Inputs says which pile each tab counts.
--
-- 🔴 EMITTED TWICE ON PURPOSE. roast_detail_by_blend is BOTH a view and a
-- SETOF function with the same body, differing only by the function's facility
-- filter. Patching one is the easiest way to ship a half-fix, so the verify
-- block below asserts both.
--
-- 🔴 Re-emitted from 20261025000003's text by script, with every replacement
-- count asserted. The origin dossier's T1 says to edit 20260829000005; that is
-- not the live text and following it would silently revert eight re-emits.
--
-- 🔴 OUTPUT SIGNATURE UNCHANGED. Both bodies gain CTEs and no columns, so no
-- type regen and no frontend change. `in_stock_roasted` already sums
-- `applied_stock`, which now carries the allocation.

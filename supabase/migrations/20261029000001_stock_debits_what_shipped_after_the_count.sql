-- Stock debits what shipped after the count, not what shipped before the
-- orders week.
--
-- THE BUG, IN ONE LINE: finished stock CREDITS coffee roasted since the stock
-- count but never DEBITS coffee shipped since it.
--
-- `recipe_is` builds stock as
--     count + roasted[anchor_date, roast_week_start) - delivered[anchor_date, orders_week_start)
-- The two legs end on DIFFERENT days. A roast week anchored on Thursday and an
-- orders week anchored on Saturday put `orders_week_start` BEFORE
-- `roast_week_start` for part of every week -- the period the roast page
-- already calls `inAmbiguousPeriod`. When the stock count lands in that gap the
-- delivered window becomes [10/25, 10/24): EMPTY. Everything shipped since the
-- count is still counted as on the shelf.
--
-- Maui Coffee Roasters counted on 2026-10-25, in the gap. Measured on
-- production: Maui Blend Light and Dark were each credited 1,371.0 lbs of
-- roasted stock against 911.5 lbs of need, so `roasted_left` went to zero and
-- the planner's `if (left > 0)` guard dropped both from the roast plan
-- entirely. The owner: "for week avg its not telling us to roast any maui
-- blend lt/dk. is that one calculating right because it seems like we
-- definitley need more of that." He was right. 102.5 lbs of LT-share
-- deliveries on 10/26 and 10/28 were silently ignored, and Maui Blend is the
-- single biggest line in the facility at ~907 lbs/week.
--
-- It fires whenever the count date is at or after the orders week start, which
-- with a Thursday/Saturday pairing is 5 days out of 7.
--
-- THE FIX. Stock is "what is on the shelf when this ROAST week starts", so
-- both legs are bounded by `roast_week_start`:
--   * the delivered upper bound moves orders_week_start -> roast_week_start;
--   * its no-anchor fallback moves orders_week_start - 28d -> roast_week_start
--     - 28d, so the two legs cover the same span. They were 5 days apart, which
--     fed deliveries with no matching roasts into a GREATEST(0, ...) that then
--     floored the whole bulk term to zero -- the reason 51 of 61 recipes showed
--     only their packed-bag count as stock.
--
-- The same inversion appears TWICE. `component_raw`'s `cc_delivered` lateral
-- has it as well, against a component count instead of a blend count. Both move
-- here; fixing one would have left the per-origin view disagreeing with the
-- per-recipe one.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED: the two windows that ask an ORDERS question -- the
-- 6-week demand average over
-- `COALESCE(o2.production_date, o2.order_date) < c.orders_week_start` -- still
-- use the orders week, because that is the week orders belong to. Only the two
-- stock-depletion legs move.
--
-- The body below is the CURRENT production definition with exactly those three
-- substitutions applied programmatically. It was NOT retyped: CREATE OR REPLACE
-- rewrites the whole body, and this one is ~445 lines of thirteen chained CTEs.
--
-- The planner does not read this function directly: `roast_plan_fresh` serves
-- the maintained `roast_plan` table, which `roast_plan_recompute` fills from
-- here. The plan corrects itself on the next recompute; no backfill.
--
--
-- SECOND FIX, AND THE DECISIVE ONE: A BAG COUNT IS IN BAGS.
--
-- Both pack-count legs read `counted_bags * products.weight_lbs`, and on a case
-- variant `weight_lbs` is the WHOLE CASE. The column header says "Bags counted"
-- and the input placeholder says "bags", so the label and the arithmetic
-- disagreed -- the UI asks for bags and the maths charges cases.
--
-- Confirmed with the owner rather than guessed: he counted 230 Safeway 8oz on
-- 2026-10-25 and confirms 230 meant 230 BAGS. Every case-sized count in all of
-- production history, both taken in that one session:
--
--   Maui Blend - 8oz (Case of 10) - Safeway      230 bags  credited 1150.0  -> 115.0
--   Maui Blend - 2oz (Case of 80) - Wholesale      6 bags  credited   60.0  ->   0.8
--
-- 1,094.2 lbs of coffee that does not exist, 46% of all Maui Blend stock on the
-- books, which is why the plan told him to roast no Maui Blend LT/DK at all --
-- the single biggest line in the facility at ~907 lbs/week. The delivery-window
-- fix above does NOT recover it on its own (1,371.0 - 102.5 = 1,268.5, still
-- above the 997.3 it has to beat); this is the fix that does.
--
-- `size.units_per_case` already carries the divisor and nothing used it. A size
-- with no case packing has NULL and divides by 1, so non-case products are
-- untouched.
--
-- NO DATA EDIT. The stored numbers are bags, which is what he entered and what
-- the label asked for. Only the reader was wrong.
--
-- This is the third case-vs-unit fault on this tenant, after fallback_unit_cost
-- being a case price and resold cases depleting x1. Whenever a case variant
-- meets a per-unit quantity, assume the unit is wrong until proven.

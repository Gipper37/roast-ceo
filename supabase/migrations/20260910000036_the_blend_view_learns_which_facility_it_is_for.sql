-- roast_detail_by_blend, as a function that knows which facility it is for.
--
-- THE SHAPE PROBLEM. The view has no facility parameter: the app filters it
-- afterwards with `.eq('facility_id', X)`. Every CTE in it is referenced 2-5
-- times, and a multiply-referenced CTE is an optimisation fence, so that
-- predicate can never reach inside. The view therefore computes the WHOLE FLEET
-- on every call and discards 97% of it. Per-call cost is O(tenants) and call
-- volume is O(tenants), so the total is quadratic — adding tenant #30
-- measurably slows tenant #1. It is already 126.9 of the database's 194.4
-- CPU-hours, 65% of all execution time, over 614,282 calls.
--
-- THE FIX is to put the predicate INSIDE the query instead of wrapping it
-- around: two WHERE clauses, on facility_params and on recipe_facility, which
-- are the two CTEs rooted in `facilities`. Everything downstream fans out from
-- those, so scoping them scopes the whole thing.
--
-- MEASURED ON MAUI (5cc581b9), warm, EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS):
--
--                              exec      buffers      recipe_facility   Orders_pkey
--   view on prod today        453 ms   3,364,863      136 rows (fleet)     32,541
--   this function             198 ms   1,576,883       56 rows (Maui)       8,617
--                             -56%       -53%
--
-- The row counts are the part that matters. 136 -> 56 and 32,541 -> 8,617 is the
-- fleet-wide fan-out disappearing: the per-call cost is now O(this tenant), not
-- O(all tenants). That is the quadratic gone, not merely made cheaper.
--
-- 🔴 NO `NOT MATERIALIZED` HERE, DELIBERATELY, AND IT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
-- …034 put those hints on the VIEW and they are right there. They are wrong
-- here. Measured all four combinations on the same data:
--     hints only .................. 268 ms   1,895,199
--     hints + predicate ........... 275 ms   1,895,199   (no better than hints)
--     predicate only .............. 198 ms   1,576,883   <- this
-- Inlining and pushing down are ALTERNATIVES. Once a CTE is scoped to one
-- facility it is small, and materialising it once to reuse five times beats
-- inlining it five times. Adding the hints to this function makes it slower.
--
-- OUTPUT IS IDENTICAL, proven rather than assumed: run per facility against the
-- live view and compared as an md5 of the whole sorted result set. All six
-- facilities matched, with matching row counts (56 / 0 / 22 / 29 / 29 / 0).
--
-- SECURITY. Plain SECURITY INVOKER (the default) — RLS on the underlying tables
-- applies as the caller, so asking for a facility you cannot see returns
-- nothing. That is the same posture 20260910000001 gave the view.
--
-- THE VIEW STAYS. It keeps its …034 hints and keeps working for anything not
-- migrated to this function. Removing it is a separate change, after this one
-- has been in front of real roasts.
